# Release verification — 2026-10-16

Actual development and release preparation 2026-10-16. This report records checks on the sanitized public source copy before its initial commit. Deployment is checked separately after pushing, without backdated commits. Passing these bounded checks does not guarantee every future feed, model response or workload.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Clean source environment | `uv sync --frozen`, project-specific `scripts/bootstrap.py`: passed |
| Native suite | **53 passed** with Python 3.14.8; FastAPI/Starlette emitted a TestClient deprecation warning |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .`: passed; pinned upstream corpus files excluded from project style rules |
| Docker | Digest-pinned Python 3.13 image built; startup, HTTP health and application page passed |
| Workflow | 66 pinned Flask/Zod files indexed with actual parser; definitions/imports inspected |
| Persistence | Restarted app container; workflow state retained |
| Browser | Isolated Chromium via agent-browser 0.38.1; 7 domain assertions passed; native input/click controls passed |
| Error state | Fixture temporarily unavailable: visible recoverable error; restored fixture loads after reload |
| Responsive layout | 1440×1000 and 390×844 inspected; 390px document width with no page overflow |
| Accessibility | axe-core 4.12.1, WCAG 2 A/AA and 2.1 AA tags: **0 detected violations** |
| Privacy | Candidate-file Gitleaks scan passed; no private home paths, unrelated service IDs, credentials or mutable data included |
| Release inference | **0 model calls**; recorded original model studies remain distinct from release checks |

Browser scenarios: 66 sources and 257 exact edges; symbol search preserves selected source; reverse BFS result; language filter synchronizes source; symbol empty state; actual file nodes rendered; nonzero directed file edges.

Some axe color checks on clipped scroll contents require manual review. Visible desktop/mobile views and the authored foreground/background palette were inspected; the minimum checked ink/muted/link ratio against the declared page/panel backgrounds was 5.71:1. This is a bounded audit, not a universal accessibility certification. Scroll regions are keyboard focusable and tables accompany charts/graphs.

## Corrections and retesting

The graph now renders 66 distinct file nodes and 257 real directed edges. Language, symbol search, graph selection, source view and reverse impact remain coherent. Fresh lint exposed style issues in the evaluation-freeze script and attempts to lint unchanged upstream input; authored formatting was corrected and corpus data excluded from style rewrites.

## Recorded findings and limitations

The Pages demo searches saved parser output; it does not execute analyzed code or invoke a model. Static imports omit dynamic behavior. Full-app held-out generation included a rejected citation, and exact quotes do not prove every semantic statement.

Native tests use explicit fixtures, original-source boundary checks and simulated model responses; they do not perform live inference. See [PUBLIC_DEMO_DATA.md](PUBLIC_DEMO_DATA.md) for the curated Pages fixture and checksum, [DATA_SOURCES.md](DATA_SOURCES.md) for publisher/version/rights and [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) for attribution. Original model studies have small samples and cannot establish general performance or costs.

## Reproduce

```sh
uv sync --frozen
uv run python scripts/bootstrap.py
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
sh stack.sh up
```

Local URL: http://127.0.0.1:8284. The container limit is 512 MiB for the app, plus Docker and host process overhead. Tested one portfolio stack at a time on an ARM Mac with 8 GiB host RAM and a 2 GiB Docker VM. No GPU. Defaults use independent named volumes and localhost bindings. Stack stop retains state; no unrelated services are managed.

For Pages: `python3 -m http.server 8008 --bind 127.0.0.1 --directory docs`. With optional agent-browser 0.38.1 installed, run `sh scripts/check-pages.sh`; assertions are in `tests/pages-smoke.js`. No browser automation package is shipped to Pages.
